<h1>Fatherhood, faith, and fellowship in Arizona</h1>
<h2>David Robinson details numerous searches and other efforts to find to his son.</h2>
<p class="byline">By <a href="/">Brooke Muckerman</a> and <a href="/">Cela Migan</a>, May 22, 2023</p>

<p>On the morning of Feb. 25, the sun did not peek through the mountains surrounding the Teravalis construction site. The cold morning brought an unwelcome cast over the eerie desert. At approximately 7:45 a.m. David Robinson stood in front of over 100 volunteers and gave them earnest thank you’s, and began to explain the logistics of the day. By 8 a.m., three separate groups were formed, with three different tasks to complete. But, each group had one goal: to find any sign of Daniel Robinson. </p>
<p>The Sonoran desert is located 60 miles outside of Phoenix. The terrain is rugged but features small bouts of vegetation like cacti and shrubs. NaTyshca Pickett, a journalist located in Phoenix, first visited the desert to join one of David’s searches in the beginnings of his mission to find his son. As she approached the search site, she noted the eeriness of the environment. </p>
<p>“when you see people driving in the desert and you see nothing but the road? That’s what it was,” Pickett said.</p>
<p>“It's almost like those movies you see, when you see people driving in the desert and you see nothing but the road? That’s what it was,” Pickett said.</p>
<p>The search site was located off Sun Valley Parkway, and features picturesque views of White Tank Mountain Regional Park. Daniel was last seen at his job site there, and was reported to exhibit out-of-character behavior. Pickett said that she could imagine how one could become disoriented out in the desert, due to the vast expanses of land and lack of street lights and people in the area.</p>
<p>“I can see how he got caught up out here,” </p>
<p>“I can see how he got caught up out here,” Pickett said. “I can see how something happened, because there is no one out here.” </p>
<p>The stretch of Sonoran Desert where the search was done was the last known location of Black geologist Daniel Robinson. The 24-year-old went missing in June of 2021, and was last seen leaving his worksite. His Jeep was found a month later. David Robinson, his father, said the Buckeye Police Department has not been helpful from the start, which prompted him to begin completing his own searches. The A-team formed also in response to the lack of help from law enforcement, and their concern for David’s lack of support in Arizona. Over the last two years, David has formed his own community in Buckeye and Phoenix, hoping to complete his mission of finding his son. One of the final searches of the desert where his son was last seen was completed on Feb. 25, the area will soon be developed into a master planned community. </p>
<p>Day before, why was David searching searchingCalm before the search?</p>
<p>David visited the site the night before, and did not think the roster of over 100 volunteers would be able to complete his final search. The gate he was hoping to use was lockedHe found the gate he hoped to use locked, even after prior communication that it would in fact be accessible. He then went to the gate that had been used for searches in the past, and saw it was unlocked. David thought to himself he would no longer be able to search the site he had planned on and would have to come up with a different plan. The original search site would have been more accessible than the actual one. One search area, where the Arizona Rangers were set to search, was much harder to access because of the rough and rigid terrain. As David traveled to that specific site from the unlocked gate, he knew that his ATV could make it, but cars might not be able to. </p>
<p>When he returned to the gate, David said he had to swerve into the road to avoid someone walking in his direction. He then realized he would have to tell his team they would be unable to search the desired area.  David put his head on the steering wheel of the ATV, and spoke to God —praying for a solution to this obvious problem. -I would love to see you sprinkle a bit on his faith as a prelude to what comes later</p>
<p>David put his head on the steering wheel of the ATV, and spoke to God —praying for a solution to this obvious problem</p>
<p>When he picked his head up and looked at the ground, he saw a road that led to the anticipated site. He then drove down the sand pacted road and was welcomed by the locked gate, but he knew his volunteers would be able to search the next morning via this detour.</p>
<p>Day of search, the beginnings of the final searchSunrise in a sundown town?</p>
<p>The morning began hours before the crowd of volunteers arrived. At around 6 a.m. David led the group down the same sand paven road he found the night before. When they arrived at what would soon become the command center, the caravan of carsneed verb parked neatly in a line as requested by David.People set up tents and tables illuminated only by car headlights as the sun had yet to emerge. </p>
<p>There was no obvious leader present —it was almost as if every individual knew their role and what they had to do.Jokes accompanied by hushed laughter punctuated the otherwise quiet and somber atmosphere. As the morning progressed, the once barren site featured two tents, two tables and a roaring ATV. Under the tables, coolers were filled with water and gatorade. Boxes were opened to reveal chips and snacks to hand out to volunteers who would soon arrive.  </p>
<p>As the volunteers trickled in, the once silent area filled in with 100+is this AP style? people all willing to search for Daniel. As the crowd gathered around the command center, David made sure to greet everyone who approached him. Some were regular faces at the searches, others said it was their first time. Volunteers were all asked to sign in, and told when they left for the day they had to also sign out. This was to avoid anyone going missing or the team leaving without having everyone accounted for. When David began to speak, everyone listened. Phones were put away, side conversations were hushed and all eyes were locked on David. -how did he speak? In the middle of a circle? With a megaphone?</p>
<p>David split the large group into three. One group was to be a part of a line search. Each member would carefully align into a straight line, and walk slowly for around one mile. The line searchers are all responsible for an unmarked line that sits directly in front of them. All members were told to stay in their line, and also walk at the same pace as one another. </p>
<p>The second group was tasked with the hasty search. This group walked as far as they could in one direction. Some were slower, some were faster. This group was filled with hikers and other volunteers who knew the terrain better and were comfortable with being away from larger groups. They were searching the area that was beyond where the line search was.</p>
<p>The final group was the team of Arizona Rangers, and they were much farther out than the other volunteers. They were the last group to leave the command center, because in order to get to their site they had to travel in a vehicle.  </p>
<p>The line search group walked slowly, examining the grounds carefully and methodically. All dressed in warm gear, hiking boots with water bottles in tow. The large group featured people from all walks of life, from avid true crime followers to Forensic Entomology Professor from Arizona State University Dr. Laruen Weidner and a group of her students. Dr. Weidner and her students completed a “Cold Case Symposium'' about Dainel Robison’s case. David spoke at the symposium's debut. </p>
<p>Although the loss of his son has been hard, David has turned this loss into his mission. He spends days alone in the desert, searching without volunteers. The desert is strikingly quiet David said, and when he is out alone he keeps his ATV running so that there is some sound around him. </p>
<p>The line searchers trudged neatly in a line through the barren landscape. Occasionally, a shout could be heard urging the volunteers to stop. Every time the volunteers were asked to hold their position, a trained member of the A-team would rush to the volunteer that shouted. Stopping meant someone found something. </p>
<p>Not every hold, or stop would merit further investigation by a forensic team, as there are animal bones scattered in every wilderness area. Sometimes, volunteers would yell for branches, confusing them with bones. Other times, the nestle of bones would be bagged and shipped off to a testing site to confirm if they were human remains. </p>
<p>David said his  </p>
<p>-this is a great place to talk about anticipation: grappling with hope or dread on what the bones may yield</p>
<p>All about Daniel and Davidwould Meet the Robinsons be bad/too light?</p>
<p>Daniel grew up in South Carolina, with his mother, father and three siblings. As the youngest of his siblings, Daniel was competitive—always wanting to beat his older siblings in video games and academically. Daniel had the  “I could do a lot better, I can challenge myself” mentality David said. </p>
<p>“He played to beat his siblings,” David said. </p>
<p>Daniel was born without his right hand, but his father said that never stopped him from doing anything he set his mind to. Daniel taught himself how to play the french horn, in high school he played sports and was awarded for his academic achievements according to David. </p>
<p>“We always had him keep getting awards all the time,” David said. </p>
<p>His older siblings motivated him to keep achieving higher and higher. David said he looked to his older brother who was also very academically inclined. Conversations in their home  revolved around science and technology. His older brother, a computer engineer, one sister an archaeologist the other a marine biologist. </p>
<p>“Somebody comes into the household and they hear our conversations and they are about science and stuff,” David said. “People get confused but that's the way we communicate with each other.” </p>
<p>David grew up without his father in his life, and he said that motivated him to be present for his children. Even throughout college, father and son remained close. David said he wanted his children to be able to talk to him, and have the relationship he didn’t have.with his own father. </p>
<p>“I wanted to be able to talk to my dad, wanted to be able to go fishing, whatever the case may be,” David said. “Our relationship was really good with that.” </p>
<p>Growing up in the projects, David remembers not having much. Days would go by without food on the table, but his mother always figured it out. There was one night that David recalled about growing up, and is one of his favorite stories of faith and trust. </p>
<p>Faith has been one of the major motivators for David throughout his search for Daniel. David shared a memory of ….get into when his mother did not have food and she would set out empty placemats and one day she did the same thing and a neighbor came and knocked on the door and gave them so many groceries that they didn’t even have room. 11:00</p>
<p>David said he sheltered his children, and they did not have many friends growing up. They had friends in school, but they did not hang out outside of the school buildings. David raised them this way to show them that the world is bigger than South Carolina. So, when Daniel chose to move to Arizona to pursue his geology career it was unsurprising. </p>
<p>Daniel attended schools that were not in his home district growing up because his father wanted him to have opportunities he did not. David decided he would take them to “mixed schools” as he called them. He did say, it caused some naivety surrounding racism for all four of his children. </p>
<p>“Daniel and his siblings are like that, they would not recognize racism like how I would,” David said.  </p>
<p>Daniel enrolled at the College of Charleston as an undeclared major, but soon chose to study geology within his first year. In college, Daniel developed many friendships, something that worried his father. David wanted his children to focus on their academics because he and his now ex-wife were not given the same opportunities they had growing up. David recalled one memory of Daniel’s college experience that still does not sit right with him. </p>
<p>“One of the things that bothered me the most is when I found out his nickname. If he was to go to College of Charleston right now they would know him as WAP,” David said. </p>
<p>He went on to explain he remembered hearing that term before, so he Googled it. WAP was a term used during slavery when enslaved persons were caught off the plantation without their papers. </p>
<p>“His friends would say it (WAP) to his face without realizing they was being racist to him,” David said. -were or weren’t the friends intentionally being racist then?</p>
<p>After graduation, David moved to Tempe, AZ where he was working as a hydrologist for Matrix New World. When he was in the desert, he was looking at groundwater supply</p>
<p>David and his activism + the A-teamFaith as an action word, there’s a great quote of David saying this</p>
<p>The Please Help Find Daniel website features much more than information about Daniel’s disappearance. David has turned into an activist for the large community of people who have missing family members. Every Wednesday, David goes live on his YouTube channel to discuss updates from the case, how to help and also how to support others who are struggling with similar situations. </p>
<p>(get more into who the A-team is, the individual members ect) </p>
<p>Shauna Brown is a licensed professional counselor and started her work with David as a concerned citizen after hearing about Daniel’s case, later becoming a member of his team.</p>
<p>“Since we met, we've been meeting about a year now, February of last year,” Brown said. “We started this team where basically, we all collaborate together, what next steps might need to be done.”</p>
<p>As volunteers, the team answers emails, moderates Q&As on David’s YouTube channel, accompanies him to meetings with law enforcement and assists with anything else David may need.</p>
<p>David rode through the desert with his ATV for the majority of the morning while his A-Team members were posted at the command center. He was constantly checking on all the volunteers, making sure they had water and food if they needed it. Frequently, David made stops to show landmarks of Daniel's missing persons case. He would point out places where they had searched already and explain why they searched them. The website which David runs has a sector map, which marks the areas where they had already searched. </p>
<p>One group of searchers was a collection of law enforcement officials and the Arizaon Rangers. The area where the heavily armed Arizona Rangers were located during the search was near where Daniels car was found. They strapped on their weapons as a drone pilot set up his gear, then they began their portion of the search. The reason for the guns? David explained that there is a mountain lion who lives in the area, and although they had not had any issues with it, he prioritized their safety over anything. A constant theme of the day revolved around David constantly making sure his volunteers were safe and well hydrated during their individual expeditions. </p>
<p>Why is this the last search? Transition into Teravails and the future of the searches</p>
<p>Since his son went missing, David has completed 45 searches of the stretch of desert where Daniel went missing. The location where Daniel went missing is now the site for a new planned community, Teravalis, which boasts that it will be a completely self-sustaining city using groundwater as their main source of water. </p>
<p>When Daniel went missing, he was working as a </p>
<p>Closure and ambiguous loss -i think this needs to come earlier, maybe after David talks about why he’s conflicted when they find bones on the search</p>
<p>-we can talk about the anticipation he’s feeling, and then lead into what finding or not finding Daniel would mean</p>
<p>Closure/ambiguous loss definition: “Ambiguous loss is simply an unclear loss that has no verification of life or death,” said Pauline Boss, professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota who coined the term.</p>
<p>Although no longer practicing, Boss taught a “Both/And” approach for families of the missing, where one considers possibilities in the wake of uncertainty: the loved one is missing and they may come back.</p>
<p>“You embrace the uncertainty”</p>
<p>“But also if somebody in the family is missing,” Boss said. “So it's like you embrace the uncertainty. You don't deny it. You don't go for an absolute, ‘He's dead to me.’ Well, you don't know for sure.”</p>
<p>Brown “I don't use the word closure often. I have used it. It depends on, in what state the person is in. I think I work more towards the acceptance of not just what has occurred, but the acceptance of the change within their life, how things would go on continually different, because many want to continue to go back to what it was.”Now, David is: “He is still pushing for this transition from Buckeye to take the case. Push the case to either the FBI, the Maricopa County, still working on that. It would be nice since everything still has not been searched out there in the desert.” Brown said.</p>
