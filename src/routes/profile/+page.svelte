<h1>Lost in Buckeye</h1>
<h2>Searching for Daniel Robinson</h2>
<p class="byline">By <a href="/">Brooke Muckerman</a> and <a href="/">Cela Migan</a>, May 22, 2023</p>

<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>
    Some 60 miles TK of Phoenix in the Sonoran desert, David Robinson moved briskly through a crowd of volunteers. Robinson is a U.S. Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan. On this chilly morning, he was again dressed for combat: boots, camo fatigues, holstered firearm. He was in full command of his troops by 7:45 a.m., issuing orders, explaining logistics, zipping across the rugged landscape in his ATV. By 8 a.m., Robinson’s team leaders had divided volunteers into groups and were fanning out across the desert on a special mission: to find any sign of Daniel Robinson. 
</p>
<p>
    Daniel is David Robinson’s son. He went missing TK, 2021. At the time, he was 24 years old working as a geologist when he disappeared from a desert work site in Buckeye, Arizona. A month later, his Jeep was found overturned in a ravine near TK. Inside the vehicle, investigators found TK and TK and TK but have not offered new evidence since.
</p>
<p>
    As the department said in TK, its most recent statement. “TK”
</p>
<p>
    Robinson’s suspicions about Buckeye PD’s handling of his son’s case formed early. Whether it was initial theories that Daniel may have run off and joined a monastery, to lax handling of critical evidence, Robinson says he gradually lost confidence in the department’s investigation. He decided to take matters into his own hands. 
</p>
<p>
    On TK, he got in his TK car and drove TK miles west from his Columbia, South Carolina home to Phoenix, rented a small apartment, and started searching for Daniel – every single day. That was two years ago. Since then, he has hired (and fired) a private investigator, launched a GoFundMe campaign, started a Missing Persons channel on YouTube, and much more. He has also conducted 45 searches in this desert.
</p>
<p>
    On this morning, some 100 volunteers had come from as far east as Vermont and as far west as Oregon to help Robinson search a swath of desert known as TK, off Sun Valley Parkway. This TK size patch is significant to the case because of TK, and TK, and TK. Rugged and punctuated with small bouts of cacti and shrub, the terrain boasts picturesque views of White Tank Mountain Regional Park. Real estate projects are starting to flow into the area. There’s a crane on the plot of land that Robinson wants to search. Buckeye PD has told him this desert search will be his last. “Quote DR”
</p>
<p>
    David Robinson spent much of the morning canvasing the desert on his ATV while a crew of supervising volunteers – he calls them his “A-Team” – handed out waters and snacks at the command center. Meanwhile, other volunteers trudged in neat lines back and forth across the desert. Occasionally, a distant shout would cut into the silence and the volunteers would stop. Someone found something. Not every hold, or stop merited further investigation by a forensic team; there are animal bones scattered throughout the wilderness. Sometimes, volunteers would call out for a branch, confusing it with a bone. Other times, a nestle of bones would be bagged and shipped off to a testing site to confirm if they were human remains. 
</p>
<h3>Noon</h3>
<p>
    According to police reports, the last person to see Daniel Roinson was a co-worker. Offer a couple details here from the report. 
</p>
<p>
    Traversing the desert in his ATV, Robinson focused on mostly TK area, where Daniel had worked the day he disappeared. A bit more detail here. 
</p>
<p>
    Two physical traits always helped Daniel Robinson stand out in Buckeye, Arizona. His brown complexion and missing lower right arm. The most widely circulated photo of him, published by every media outlet from CNN to the Guardian, shows Daniel standing on a mountain range smiling – a vista backdrop where the bottom half an arm would typically be. 	
</p>
<p>
    Daniel was born this way, David Robinson says. Watching him rise above his physical challenges to outperform other kids (sometimes his older siblings) athletically and academically gave his parents (they divorced in 20TK) confidence in Daniel’s coping and survival skills. TK and TK Robinson had kept their children out of trouble and academically focused by limiting their interaction with neighborhood kids and enrolling them in private schools. Their early love for science proved out: TK works as a TK, and TK works as a TK, and TK works as a TK.
</p>
<p>
    In 20TK, after graduating University of Charleston, Daniel relocated to Buckeye; an adventurous, smart, and occasionally naïve young man, David Robinson says. He found employment working as a geologist (he delivered for Grubhub on the side).  He and Daniel spoke regularly, he says, sometimes for hours as Daniel shared stories about his workday or sought advice about his career and personal life.
</p>
<p>
    In the days leading up to his disappearance, he did not did not mention to his father his fraying connection to a woman he met one night when he delivered alcohol to her home and was invited to drink with her and a roommate. In text messages obtained by investigators, Daniel over the next several days expressed romantic interest in the woman, and even once showed up at her home unannounced – despite her rejections.  “Quote text.” Buckeye PD has not classified the exchanges as evidence in Daniel Robinson’s disappearance.
</p>
<h3>
    Night
</h3>
<p>
    A few hours after the search, David Robinson sipped bottled water and shared a story. The military had trained him to keep a lid on his emotions, but last night he was close to tears, he said.  It was dusk and he had driven the TK miles from Phoenix to scope out the area and prepare for the arrival of nearly 100 volunteers. But the entry gate was padlocked  – despite the fact that Bucktown PD had signed off weeks ago on Robinson’s request for access. Robinson says he put his head on his ATV steering wheel and prayed to God that Buckeye PD had not blocked him from searching for his son. Then it occurred to him there was another gate nearby he’d used in previous searches which might be an option. He drove the ATV a few hundred yards up the road and found the gate. It was unlocked.  
</p>
<p>
    Robinson says he believes in miracles. His mother raised him and his TK siblings in subsidized housing where they survived on prayer. He remembers a time, back when he was in grade school, there was no food in the house and his mother set the table with her best dishes anyway, filling the tea cups with hot water and telling Robinson and his siblings to imagine eating a good meal. It felt strange chewing invisible food, he says, but him and his siblings obeyed mom. 
</p>
<p>
    Not long after, he says, there was a knock at the door and a neighbor was standing on the front porch holding a bag of groceries. The following week more groceries arrived from around the neighborhood until the refrigerator and cupboards overflowed. Faith is evidence unseen, he says. “Quote”
